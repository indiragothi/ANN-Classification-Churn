# Neural Network Architecture

1. Sequential Network

2. Dense Layer → 64 neurons

3. Activation Functions → Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU

4. Optimizer → Backpropagation → Updating the weights

5. Loss Function

6. Metrics → [Accuracy], [MRE, MAE]

7. Training → Logs → Folders → TensorBoard → Visualization
